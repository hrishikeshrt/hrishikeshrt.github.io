      <description>&lt;p&gt;Majority of the Sanskrit literature is in the form of poetry that adheres to the
rules of Sanskrit prosody or Chandaḥśāstra, which is the study of Sanskrit
meters, known as chandas. The purpose of chanda is primarily to add rhythm to
the text so that it is easier to memorize. Additionally, it also helps in
preserving the correctness to some extent. Chandojñānam is a web-based Sankrit
prosodical meter identification and utilization system. In addition to the core
functionality of identifying meters from Sanskrit text, it provides fuzzy (i.e.,
approximate and close) matches for text that does not correspond exactly to a
known metrical pattern. This opens up the scope of a meter based correction of
erroneous digital corpora. The system supports identification of meters from
uploaded images by using optical character recognition (OCR) engines in the
backend. It is also able to process entire text files at a time. The text can be
processed in two modes, either by treating it as a list of individual lines, or
as a collection of verses.&lt;/p&gt;
