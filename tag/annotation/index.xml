      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;annotation&#34;&gt;Annotation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;One of the ways of constructing a knowledge graph is through manual annotation.
Languages whose state-of-the-art of NLP is not advanced enough for automatic construction often have to rely on the manual annotation. Benefits of annotation
include the accuracy and reliability of data, construction of datasets which further help the research in the field of automatic construction of knowledge graphs, etc.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3 id=&#34;sangrahaka&#34;&gt;Sangrahaka&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Sangrahaka&lt;/em&gt; is a web-based tool for annotating entities and
relationships from text corpora towards construction of a knowledge graph
and subsequent querying using templatized natural language questions. It is a language and corpus agnostic tool.  Salient features of the tool include an interface for annotation of entities and relationships, and an interface for querying using templatized natural language queries. The tool is also equipped with an administrators’ interface for managing user access levels, uploading corpora and ontology creation. There are utility scripts for language-specific or corpus-specific needs. The tool can be deployed on the web for distributed annotation by multiple annotators. Besides having a user-friendly interface, it is
fast, supports customization, and is fault-tolerant on both client and
server side. No programming knowledge is expected from an annotator.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The tool has been used in real-world annotation tasks and has received generally positive reviews.&lt;/p&gt;
