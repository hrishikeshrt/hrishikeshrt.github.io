One can find several options based on the purpose, aesthetics, technologies and difficulty.\nSome of the easiest options include Google Sites, WordPress etc. If one wants to have a bit more control and customizability, there are static site builders like Hugo, Jekyll, Gatsby, etc. which can be hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify etc. For an academic portfolio, I found \u0026ldquo;Hugo Academic\u0026rdquo; to be perfect, both aesthetically and feature-wise.\n\u0026ldquo;Hugo Academic\u0026rdquo; comes with an easy deployment option to Netlify, which doesn\u0026rsquo;t require the user to write any code. To deploy it to GitHub is not as straightforward and too many guides for too many versions might confuse a novice user. Here, I am listing down the steps I followed to setup this website. This, by no means, is the only way or the easiest way to setup the website, but it is to the point and it worked for me.\nGet Started using GitHub Template  Install Hugo Go to \u0026ldquo;Hugo Academic\u0026rdquo; Starter Template Click on Use this template to create a repository www (you may choose a different name) Clone your repository locally git clone git@github.com:\u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/www.git www cd www git submodule update --init --recursive Create an empty repository \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;.github.io on GitHub, if you haven\u0026rsquo;t already.  Note: If you do not have GitHub premium, this must be a public repository in order to use GitHub Pages Set-up the GitHub Pages from repository settings.   Add the website repository as a submodule, git submodule add -f -b master git@github.com:\u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;.github.io.git public Edit content in the content directory Test locally, hugo server Generate public pages, hugo. This will generate the static website in the public/ directory. Commit content to the submodule (website repository) first, cd public, git add . and git commit -m \u0026quot;Website\u0026quot; Commit content to the base repository, git add . and git commit -m \u0026quot;Content\u0026quot;  Reference Documentation: https://wowchemy.com/docs/\n Following are the contents of the sample post that come with the installation.

Languages whose state-of-the-art of NLP is not advanced enough for automatic construction often have to rely on the manual annotation. Benefits of annotation include the accuracy and reliability of data, construction of datasets which further help the research in the field of automatic construction of knowledge graphs, etc.\nSangrahaka Sangrahaka is a web-based tool for annotating entities and relationships from text corpora towards construction of a knowledge graph and subsequent querying using templatized natural language questions. It is a language and corpus agnostic tool. Salient features of the tool include an interface for annotation of entities and relationships, and an interface for querying using templatized natural language queries. The tool is also equipped with an administrators’ interface for managing user access levels, uploading corpora and ontology creation. There are utility scripts for language-specific or corpus-specific needs. The tool can be deployed on the web for distributed annotation by multiple annotators. Besides having a user-friendly interface, it is fast, supports customization, and is fault-tolerant on both client and server side.

In this paper, we target the problem of building knowledge graphs for particular types of relationships from Saṃskṛta texts. We build a natural language question-answering system in Saṃskṛta that uses the knowledge graph to answer factoid questions. We design a framework for the overall system and implement two separate instances of the system on human relationships from Mahābhārata and Rāmāyaṇa, and one instance on synonymous relationships from Bhāvaprakāśa Nighaṇṭu, a technical text from Āyurveda. We show that about 50% of the factoid questions can be answered correctly by the system. More importantly, we analyse the shortcomings of the system in detail for each step, and discuss the possible ways forward.","tags":["Question Answering","Sanskrit","Knowledge Graph"],"title":"Framework for Question-Answering in Sanskrit through Automated Construction of Knowledge Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hrishikesh Terdalkar","Arnab Bhattacharya"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1571788800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1571788800,"objectID":"01496dd6aa227594109fc4b7a09176ae","permalink":"/publication/iscls2019demo/","publishdate":"2019-10-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/iscls2019demo/","section":"publication","summary":"The *Kaṭapayādi* system of encoding numbers as words by replacing each digit by a character was developed in ancient India.
