Extracting the knowledge from it, however, is a challenging task due to multiple reasons including complexity of the language and paucity of standard natural language processing tools. In this paper, we target the problem of building knowledge graphs for particular types of relationships from Sa·πÉsk·πõta texts. We build a natural language question-answering system in Sa·πÉsk·πõta that uses the knowledge graph to answer factoid questions. We design a framework for the overall system and implement two separate instances of the system on human relationships from MahƒÅbhƒÅrata and RƒÅmƒÅya·πáa, and one instance on synonymous relationships from BhƒÅvaprakƒÅ≈õa nigha·πá·π≠u, a technical text from ƒÄyurveda. We show that about 50% of the factoid questions can be answered correctly by the system. More importantly, we analyse the shortcomings of the system in detail for each step, and discuss the possible ways forward.","tags":["Question Answering","Sanskrit","Knowledge Graph"],"title":"Framework for Question-Answering in Sanskrit through Automated Construction of Knowledge Graphs","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hrishikesh Terdalkar","Arnab Bhattacharya"],"categories":null,"content":" Click the Cite button above to demo the feature to enable visitors to import publication metadata into their reference management software.
