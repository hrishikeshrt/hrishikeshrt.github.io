It is one of the oldest surviving languages, with a documented history spanning over 2,000 years. Tamil is a classical language and it is official in three countries including India and various diasporic communities around the world speak it. Learning Tamil Grammar is still challenging due to its Agglutination and Complex Morphology. We created a Tamil Grammar Corpus focusing all kinds of learners and manually annotated the corpus since automated tools are not efficient enough. This made us to create a ontology on entity types and relationship types for the same. We identified entities and relationships and store the resultant triplets (subject-predicate–object) as a Knowledge Graph (KG) consisting of 63,587 entities. We also developed a framework for templatized Question-Answering along with it. We performed bi-fold evaluation (Query metrics and Human-Centric based) with thorough experimentation and show that our QA system is robust, reliable and fun in answering various objective questions.","tags":["tamil","question answering","natural language processing","annotation","dataset","ontology"],"title":"Aganittyam: Learning Tamil Grammar through Knowledge Graph based Templatized Question Answering","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Chaitali Dangarikar","Arnab Bhattacharya","Karthika N J","Hrishikesh Terdalkar","Pramit Bhattacharyya","Annarao Kulkarni","Chaitanya S Lakkundi","Ganesh Ramakrishnan","Shivani V"],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1729728000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1729728000,"objectID":"82a9655a9862fa2f5d5d5c38d23efa99","permalink":"/publication/aioc2024/","publishdate":"2024-10-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/aioc2024/","section":"publication","summary":"Interlingua serves as a constructed bridge language, designed to simplify communication and analysis across diverse natural languages by identifying commonalities in structure and meaning.

The tool is Unicode-compatible, language-agnostic, Web-deployable and supports distributed annotation by multiple simultaneous annotators. The system sports user-friendly interfaces for 8 categories of annotation tasks. These, in turn, enable the annotation of a considerably larger set of NLP tasks. The task categories include two linguistic tasks not handled by any other tool, namely, sentence boundary detection and deciding canonical word order, which are important tasks for text that is in the form of poetry. We propose the idea of sequential annotation based on small text units, where an annotator performs several tasks related to a single text unit before proceeding to the next unit. The research applications of the proposed mode of multi-task annotation are also discussed. *Antarlekhaka* outperforms other annotation tools in objective evaluation. It has been also used for two real-life annotation tasks on two different languages, namely, Sanskrit and Bengali.

However, the need for simpler texts led to the emergence of the Laghu-Trayī that includes Mādhavanidāna, Śārṅgadharasaṃhitā, and Bhāvaprakāśa. Authored by Ācārya Bhāvamiśra in the 16th century CE, Bhāvaprakāśa is a comprehensive work focused on medicine. The classification system of varga in its nighaṇṭu section, Bhāvaprakāśanighaṇṭu, categorizes substances based on type, origin, and medicinal properties. This valuable resource assists practitioners and researchers in Āyurveda. We present this information in an accessible manner to promote wider utilization of this knowledge. We create a robust ontology to capture the semantic information of medicinal substances, designing user-friendly interfaces for efficient annotation and curation, perform meticulous manual annotation on Bhāvaprakāśanighaṇṭu, and construct an accurate knowledge graph from three chapters of Bhāvaprakāśanighaṇṭu.

Knowledge Graphs (KG) are KBs that use graph as the underlying data structure. Knowledge-based systems are software that utilize knowledge bases to solve problems. In the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP), Question Answering (QA) is a problem of finding answers to natural language questions posed by humans. KGs are an integral part of addressing the problem of question answering. Difficulty of constructing knowledge graphs depends greatly on the language and the resources available, such as datasets, tools and technologies.\nSanskrit is a classical language with a vast amount of written literature on a wide variety of topics. However, most of this literature is not available in a format that is readily usable by computer systems. As a result, from a computational perspective, Sanskrit is still considered a low-resource language.\nIn this thesis, we make contributions towards the ultimate goal of question answering in Sanskrit through construction of various knowledge-based systems in Sanskrit. We first present a framework that attempts to answer factual questions through an automated construction of KGs. We highlight the shortcomings and limitations of the state-of-the-art of Sanskrit NLP. The scarcity of appropriate datasets poses a significant challenge in the development and evaluation of automated systems for knowledge graph construction. Human annotation plays an important role for the creation of such datasets. There is also a need for annotation tools with task-specific and intuitive interfaces to simplify the tedious task of manual annotation.\nWe present Sangrahaka, an annotator-friendly, web-based tool for ontology-driven annotation of entities and relationships towards the construction of knowledge graphs. It also supports querying. The tool is language and corpus-agnostic but customizable for specific needs. We demonstrate the usefulness of the tool through a real-world annotation task on Bhāvaprakāśanighaṇṭu, an Āyurveda text. We showcase a carefully constructed extensive ontology suitable for this task, resulting in annotations that contribute to the development of a knowledge graph and querying framework. These contributions are based on three chapters from Bhāvaprakāśanighaṇṭu.\nThen, we present Antarlekhaka, a general purpose multi-task annotation system for manual annotation of a comprehensive set of NLP tasks. The system supports annotation towards multiple categories of NLP tasks: sentence boundary detection, canonical word ordering, token annotation, token classification, token graph, sentence classification and sentence graph. The annotation is performed in a sequential manner for small logical units of text (e.g., a verse). We highlight the utility of the tool through the application of the tool for the annotation of Vālmīki Rāmāyaṇa, resulting in datasets for NLP tasks of sentence boundary detection, canonical word ordering, named entity recognition, action graph construction and co-reference resolution.\nBoth Sangrahaka and Antarlekhaka are presented as full-stack web-based software to support distributed annotation. They are designed to be easily configurable, web-deployable, customizable and with a multi-tier permission system. They are actively being used in real-world annotation tasks. The annotator-friendly and intuitive annotation interfaces of these tools have received positive feedback from the users, and they outperform other annotation tools in objective evaluation.\nSanskrit text corpora have undergone large-scale digitization efforts using OCR technology, inadvertently leading to the introduction of various errors. In this thesis, we present Chandojñānam, a system for identifying and utilizing Sanskrit meters. Apart from its core functionality of meter identification, the system also enables finding fuzzy matches based on sequence matching, thereby facilitating the correction of inaccuracies in digital corpora. The user-friendly interface of Chandojñānam displays the scansion, a graphical representation of the metrical pattern. Additionally, the system supports meter identification from uploaded images through the utilization of optical character recognition (OCR) engines. The text can be processed in either line-by-line mode or verse-by-verse mode.\nFinally, as part of our research contribution, we offer an extensive range of web-interfaces, tools, and software libraries specifically designed to highlight and utilize the computational aspects of Sanskrit. This diverse compilation includes Jñānasaṅgrahaḥ, a comprehensive web-based collection of various computational applications dedicated to the Sanskrit language.

Thus, in this work, we describe our efforts on manual annotation of Sanskrit text for the purpose of knowledge graph (KG) creation. We choose the chapter Dhānyavarga from Bhāvaprakāśanighaṇṭu of the Ayurvedic text Bhāvaprakāśa for annotation. The constructed knowledge graph contains 410 entities and 764 relationships. Since Bhāvaprakāśanighaṇṭu is a technical glossary text that describes various properties of different substances, we develop an elaborate ontology to capture the semantics of the entity and relationship types present in the text. To query the knowledge graph, we design 31 query templates that cover most of the common question patterns. For both manual annotation and querying, we customize the Sangrahaka framework previously developed by us. The entire system including the dataset is available from https://sanskrit.iitk.ac.in/ayurveda.

It serves for achieving brevity in expressing thoughts, while simultaneously enriching the lexical and structural formation of the language. In this work, we focus on the Sanskrit Compound Type Identification (SaCTI) task, where we consider the problem of identifying semantic relations between the components of a compound word. Earlier approaches solely rely on the lexical information obtained from the components and ignore the most crucial contextual and syntactic information useful for SaCTI. However, the SaCTI task is challenging primarily due to the implicitly encoded context-sensitive semantic relation between the compound components. Thus, we propose a novel multi-task learning architecture which incorporates the contextual information and enriches the complementary syntactic information using morphological tagging and dependency parsing as two auxiliary tasks. Experiments on the benchmark datasets for SaCTI show 6.1 points (Accuracy) and 7.7 points (F1-score) absolute gain compared to the state-of-the-art system. Further, our multi-lingual experiments demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed architecture in English and Marathi languages.","tags":["sanskrit","multi-task learning","compound identification","annotation"],"title":"A Novel Multi-Task Learning Approach for Context-Sensitive Compound Type Identification in Sanskrit","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hrishikesh Terdalkar"],"categories":[],"content":"Majority of the Sanskrit literature is in the form of poetry that adheres to the rules of Sanskrit prosody or Chandaḥśāstra, which is the study of Sanskrit meters, known as chandas.

The script is being used for more than 120 languages, some of the more notable languages being, Sanskrit, Hindi, Marathi, Pali, Nepali and several variations of these languages.\nDevanagari text can be transliterated in various standard schemes. There exist several input systems based on these transliteration schemes to enable users easily input the text. More often than not, a user has a preference of scheme to type the input in. Similarly, at times, one faces a need to render it in a different scheme in the PDF document.\nIn my case, I prefer using ibus-m17n to type text in Devanagari. While writing articles that contain Devanagari text, I also faced the need to render the text as IAST in the final PDF. One could always learn to input text in another input scheme, but that may get tedious. Similarly, transliterating each word using online systems such as Aksharamukha can also be a tedious task. So, I was looking for a way where I can type in Devanagari, and have it rendered in IAST after PDF compilation. As a solution, I came up with a system consisting of a small set of LaTeX commands to add custom syntax to LaTeX and a python transliteration script (based on indic-transliteration package) to serve as a middle-layer and process the LaTeX file to create a new LaTeX file with proper transliteration.\nLaTeX Compilation System with Transliteration Support There are two primary components to the system,\nLaTeX Synatx Transliteration Script LaTeX Syntax XeTeX (xelatex) and LuaTeX (lualatex) have good unicode support and can be used to write Devanagari text. In the current example, I mention the setup with XeTeX.\nWe first add the required packages in the preamble of the LaTeX (.tex) file.\n% This assumes your files are encoded as UTF8 \\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % Devanagari Related Packages \\usepackage{fontspec, xunicode, xltxtra} Using fontspec, we can define environments for font families, to write text in specific scripts. To write Devanagari text, one needs to have a Devanagari font available. (It is assumed here that one may need to write both in Devanagari as well as other transliteration schemes.)\nFor more on Devanagari fonts, you may check the fonts section of this document. In this section, it is assumed that Sanskrit 2003 font is installed in the system.\nTo define the environments as mentioned earlier, we add the following lines in the preamble.\n% Define Fonts \\newfontfamily\\textskt[Script=Devanagari]{Sanskrit 2003} \\newfontfamily\\textiast{Noto Serif} % Commands for Devanagari Transliterations \\newcommand{\\skt}[1]{{\\textskt{#1}}} \\newcommand{\\iast}[1]{{\\textiast{#1}}} \\newcommand{\\Iast}[1]{{\\textiast{#1}}} \\newcommand{\\IAST}[1]{{\\textiast{#1}}} This provides us with four commands. \\skt{} can be used to render Devanagari text. \\iast{}, \\Iast{} and \\IAST{} can be used to render devanagari text in IAST format in lower case, title case and upper case respectively. It should be noted that from the perspective of LaTeX engine, the commands \\iast{}, \\Iast{} and \\IAST{} are identical. They are just different syntactically to aid the python script to perform transliteration and apply appropriate modifications. It should further be noted that we can define new font families and new commands for any of the valid schemes as per the requirement, which can potentially give us additional commands such \\velthuis{}, \\hk{} and so on.\nMinimal Example Equipped with these commands, and some Devanagari text, we have a minimal example as follows, stored in the file minimal.tex,\n\\documentclass[10pt]{article} % This assumes your files are encoded as UTF8 \\usepackage[utf8]{inputenc} % Devanagari Related Packages \\usepackage{fontspec, xunicode, xltxtra} % Define Fonts \\newfontfamily\\textskt[Script=Devanagari]{Sanskrit 2003} \\newfontfamily\\textiast{Noto Serif} % Commands for Devanagari Transliterations \\newcommand{\\skt}[1]{{\\textskt{#1}}} \\newcommand{\\iast}[1]{{\\textiast{#1}}} \\newcommand{\\Iast}[1]{{\\textiast{#1}}} \\newcommand{\\IAST}[1]{{\\textiast{#1}}} \\title{Transliteration of Devanagari Text} \\author{Hrishikesh Terdalkar} \\begin{document} \\maketitle \\skt{को न्वस्मिन् साम्प्रतं लोके गुणवान् कश्च वीर्यवान्।} \\iast{को न्वस्मिन् साम्प्रतं लोके गुणवान् कश्च वीर्यवान्।} \\Iast{को न्वस्मिन् साम्प्रतं लोके गुणवान् कश्च वीर्यवान्।} \\IAST{को न्वस्मिन् साम्प्रतं लोके गुणवान् कश्च वीर्यवान्।} \\end{document} Transliteration Script The python script is used to perform transliteration and some clean-up on the LaTeX.\npython3 finalize.py minimal.tex final.tex This result in the content being transformed in the following way,\n% ... \\skt{को न्वस्मिन् साम्प्रतं लोके गुणवान् कश्च वीर्यवान्।} \\iast{ko nvasmin sāmprataṃ loke guṇavān kaśca vīryavān|} \\Iast{Ko Nvasmin Sāmprataṃ Loke Guṇavān Kaśca Vīryavān|} \\IAST{KO NVASMIN SĀMPRATAṂ LOKE GUṆAVĀN KAŚCA VĪRYAVĀN|} % ...

One can find several options based on the purpose, aesthetics, technologies and difficulty.\nSome of the easiest options include Google Sites, WordPress etc. If one wants to have a bit more control and customizability, there are static site builders like Hugo, Jekyll, Gatsby, etc. which can be hosted on GitHub Pages, Netlify etc. For an academic portfolio, I found “Hugo Academic” to be perfect, both aesthetically and feature-wise.\n“Hugo Academic” comes with an easy deployment option to Netlify, which doesn’t require the user to write any code. To deploy it to GitHub is not as straightforward and too many guides for too many versions might confuse a novice user. Here, I am listing down the steps I followed to setup this website.\nGet Started using GitHub Template Install Hugo Go to “Hugo Academic” Starter Template Click on Use this template to create a repository www (you may choose a different name) Clone your repository locally git clone git@github.com:\u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/www.git www cd www git submodule update --init --recursive Create an empty repository \u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;.github.io on GitHub, if you haven’t already. Note: If you do not have GitHub premium, this must be a public repository in order to use GitHub Pages Set-up the GitHub Pages from repository settings. Add the website repository as a submodule, git submodule add -f -b master git@github.com:\u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;/\u0026lt;your-username\u0026gt;.github.io.git public Edit content in the content directory Test locally, hugo server Generate public pages, hugo. This will generate the static website in the public/ directory.
