Languages whose state-of-the-art of NLP is not advanced enough for automatic construction often have to rely on the manual annotation. Benefits of annotation include the accuracy and reliability of data, construction of datasets which further help the research in the field of automatic construction of knowledge graphs, etc.\nSangrahaka Sangrahaka is a web-based tool for annotating entities and relationships from text corpora towards construction of a knowledge graph and subsequent querying using templatized natural language questions. It is a language and corpus agnostic tool. Salient features of the tool include an interface for annotation of entities and relationships, and an interface for querying using templatized natural language queries. The tool is also equipped with an administrators‚Äô interface for managing user access levels, uploading corpora and ontology creation. There are utility scripts for language-specific or corpus-specific needs. The tool can be deployed on the web for distributed annotation by multiple annotators. Besides having a user-friendly interface, it is fast, supports customization, and is fault-tolerant on both client and server side. No programming knowledge is expected from an annotator.\nThe tool has been used in real-world annotation tasks and has received generally positive reviews.\n  Word-art of the comments received in a survey of Sangrahaka  ","date":1627776000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1627776000,"objectID":"b2b522c0276f31a5a1ee8be9b4c8c04a","permalink":"/project/knowledge-graphs/","publishdate":"2021-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/knowledge-graphs/","section":"project","summary":"Knowledge Graphs (KGs) are knowledge bases stored using a graph data structure.

We build a natural language question-answering system in Sa·πÉsk·πõta that uses the knowledge graph to answer factoid questions.
